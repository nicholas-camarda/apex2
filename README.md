# Identification of G Protein and Î²-Arrestin Independent GPCR Signaling Partners

This codebase accompanies the manuscript titled as above. It includes a comprehensive set of R functions for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization in the context of GPCR signaling research.

## Data Preprocessing and Identifier Mapping

Data from Rajagopal, Kruse, Rockman, and Von Zastrow datasets were preprocessed and mapped to human-readable gene names for further analysis. This involved filtering, log2 transformation, and outlier removal. Protein accessions were mapped using UniProtKB and Entrez Gene identifiers for subsequent analyses in Gene Ontology/KEGG and STRINGdb.

## Combined Fisher's P-Value Calculation

We employed Fisher's method for combined p-value calculation using the "metap" R package. This involved converting two-sided p-values to one-sided, grouping by accession, and correcting the resultant combined Fisher p-values for multiple hypothesis testing.

## Gene Ontology/KEGG Enrichment and STRINGdb Analysis

The "clusterProfiler" and "STRINGdb" R packages facilitated GO/KEGG enrichment and STRINGdb protein-protein interaction, network visualization, and clustering analyses. We set specific thresholds for enrichment and interaction scores and used the FastGreedy algorithm for clustering.

## Custom R Functions

The repository includes several custom R functions to aid in data analysis and visualization:

### Visualization Functions

- `plot_fc`: For generating waterfall plots, showcasing protein expression data.
- `plot_volcano`: For creating volcano plots, highlighting significant protein expressions.

### Data Analysis Functions

- `generate_intervals`, `find_good_intervals`, `generate_quant_intervals`: Functions for interval generation in data analysis.
- `generate_my_mapped_proteins`: Maps gene names to STRINGdb IDs and summarizes data.
- `make_tbl_data`: Saves data into Excel files for further analysis.
- `plot_stringdb_interactions`, `generate_interaction_enrichment_tables`: Functions for STRINGdb interaction analysis and visualization.

### Utility Functions

- `remove_fig_number`, `p_friend`: Assist in text and data formatting.
- `make_vector_genes`: Creates a list of unique gene symbols and corresponding Entrez IDs.
- `make_naming_tribble_waterfall`, `make_naming_tribble_volcano`: Utility functions for naming and organizing plot data.
- `generate_significant_hits_interaction_network`, `generate_signif_hits_enrichment_tables`, `generate_pert_pathways`: For analyzing and visualizing significant interaction networks.

### Easy Plotting Functions

- `easy_plot_fc`, `easy_plot_volcano`: Simplified functions for quick and efficient generation of waterfall and volcano plots.

## Installation and Usage

To use these functions, clone this repository and source the functions in your R environment. Example usage for each function is provided within the function documentation. The usage order of the main executing scripts was:

- `load_and_process_data.R`
- `figure2B-D.R`
- `figures_2E-3-4.R`
- `table_1.R`
